# ILION Framework Simulator (PoC)

Reference proof-of-concept implementation of the ILION Framework runtime semantic verification kernel.

This repository contains a research-grade, stateless simulator that demonstrates:

- Transient Identity Imprint (TII)
- Semantic Vertical Resonance Field (SVRF / SCB)
- Identity Deviation Control (IDC)
- Consensus Veto Layer – dual stage (CVL)
- MACS (Moral Axiological Compatibility Score)
- IIRL multi-agent consensus

The simulator is intended strictly as a research and demonstration artifact.

It is NOT a production system and it is NOT an AI model.
It is a semantic governance and verification layer operating on embedding geometry.

## Scope

This repository represents a reference PoC implementation of the ILION framework concepts.

Its purpose is to:

- demonstrate runtime semantic control of agent decisions,
- expose axiomatic veto mechanisms,
- illustrate identity-conditioned semantic alignment,
- support academic and technical evaluation.
